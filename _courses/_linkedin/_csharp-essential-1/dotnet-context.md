## C# compiles to MSIL

C# is one of several .NET languages that compile to Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). Each .NET language has its own compiler that compiles source files (in their particular programming language) to MSIL.

.NET languages:

- F#
- C#
- Visual Basic

Because of this, the C# language can evolve and grow independent of the runtime environment. For example, there are many C# versions (4 - 7.3) that are able to compile to MSIL that can run in .NET Runtime 4. C# versions usually release together with new versions of the compiler.

We can use tools, such as IL Diassembler (ILDASM), to see what the intermediate language is, from a compiled .NET executable or library.

## .NET Runtime is responsible for running MSIL

Once C# files are compiled to MSIL, they need to be executed. The .NET Runtime is responsible for executing that intermediate language (.NET executables).

The runtime can be installed on a server or workstation, separate from the Software Development Kit(SDK). So you donÂ´t need to have the developer setup to execute MSIL in the platform you want to run your application.

Newer versions of the .NET Runtime, starting with .NET Core, are cross-platform. So they can run on Windows, Linux or MacOS. That means with C#, you can build applications that target a variety of platforms.

Another feature from newer versions is that the runtime can be deployed bundled with the application, eliminating the need for a separate instalation. This is useful for running many applications with different runtimes, in the same platform. It simplifies the deployment and management of the dependencies.

## The Base Class Library

.NET have common functionality that work for any of its supported languages, provided with the SDK, in the Base Class Library (BCL).The BCL provides types for the most basic functions, such as string manipulation, mathematical functions and date functionalities, and for more complex features, such as file manipulation and data access.

Application developers will usually build their libraries on top of the BCL and use these libraries in the application as well. They might make direct calls to BCL types, or to a custom library, or even to a third party library. There are many open source libraries (many maintained by Microsoft) available to be used (as third party) as well.

## Nuget

Nuget is a repository for libraries that provides versioning, infrastructure, developer and library information. Libraries can be published with metadata as a package to Nuget, where other developers can download and install them. Nuget Package Manager is a tool used by developers for creating nuget packages as well as installing them. Visual Studio natively supports Nuget both for creating and consuming packages.
